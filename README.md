# DecisionBoundaries
Recreating results from Andrej Karpathy's ConvNetJS 2D toy data example (https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/demo/classify2d.html).
This notebook trains a simple neural net with one hidden layer made of 3 hidden units. Then I printed out the learned parameter values and rewrote the neural net as one giant function. We can see that the net learns a triangle-liek shape, but the three corners are cut off by the interaction between the 3 hidden units.
